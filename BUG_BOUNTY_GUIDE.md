## üöÄ Step-by-Step Bug Bounty Workflow

### Phase 1: Target Selection & Reconnaissance
1. **Choose High-Value Targets**
   ```bash
   # Use the blockchain scanner to identify targets
   # Focus on protocols with high TVL (Total Value Locked)
   # Check recent deployments and upgrades
   ```

2. **Gather Intelligence**
   ```bash
   # Contract source code analysis
   # Transaction pattern analysis
   # Governance structure review
   ```

### Phase 2: Automated Scanning
1. **Generate Audit Script**
   - Enter contract address in blockchain scanner
   - Select appropriate blockchain
   - Click "Generate Audit Script"

2. **Run Comprehensive Scan**
   ```bash
   # The generated script will:
   # - Install security tools (Slither, Mythril, etc.)
   # - Perform static analysis
   # - Run symbolic execution
   # - Check for common vulnerabilities
   # - Generate professional report
   ```

### Phase 3: Manual Analysis with AI
1. **Multi-AI Code Review**
   - Use 2-3 different AI models simultaneously
   - Ask specific questions about potential vulnerabilities
   - Cross-reference findings between AIs

2. **Custom Prompt Analysis**
   ```
   "Analyze this smart contract for flash loan attack vectors. 
   Focus on external calls, state changes, and reentrancy guards. 
   Provide specific exploit scenarios and potential impact."
   ```

### Phase 4: Exploit Development
1. **Proof of Concept Creation**
   - Use AI to help write exploit code
   - Test on local blockchain fork
   - Document step-by-step exploitation
